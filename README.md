# Pokemon Brown
This open-world, multiplayer Pokemon game features item shops, PvP battling, trading, wild encounters, capturing Pokemon, level progressions, bracketed tournaments, and more. It was created as a final project for Brown University's CSCI0320 course, Intro to Software Engineering, over the course of a few weeks.

# To Run
Download the game to a server with Java 8 and Maven installed. Navigate to the root, run "mvn package" to compile, then use the run script to start the server. To join, connect to the server on port 4567 in a web browser (Chrome recommended).

# Config
Various config files are available in /config/. Some additional config options are hardcoded and can be modified in the source.

# Comments

The game isn't quite bug free. Graphical glitches occasionally require page refreshes to resolve. A time crunch left some final pieces poorly written or broken.
